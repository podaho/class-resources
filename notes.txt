Git From Terminal


-- Common Commands --

git init            (Initialize a repository) AVOID NESTED REPOS
git status          (See which files need to be added or have been added)
git add <filename>  (Add files to the staging area to be committed)
git diff --cached   (See the changes of the files that will be committed)
git commit          (Commit the changes to Git)
git log             (View all previous commits)
git rm --cached     (Remove files from staging by adding the file name)
git commit -m “”    (To add commit message without an editor)

To save commit message in Vim, type esc, then :wq

-- GitHub Set Up --

Assuming you have an account and a local repo with committed changes:

1) Create a repository (click plus button at the top of the GitHub nav bar)
2) Paste the commands on GitHub of the second option in your terminal to push initially up to GitHub


-- Best Practice --

Add and commit frequently any time you complete a small piece of functionality
Write descriptive commit messages
Push commits regularly (at least twice a day)

================================= GIT BRANCHING

Everything we have done is on the “master branch” in Git

New best practice work flow...don’t commit in the local master branch; always add and commit in another branch!

   --> FIRST STEP
    Create a new branch in your Git local repo (suggested branch name: yourName-exerciseOrFeature)...
    Command: git checkout -b “justin-box-model”

   --> SECOND STEP
    Add and commit changes as you normally would...
    Command: git add someFile, git commit someFile, etc.

   --> THIRD STEP
    Merge local branch with the local master branch...
    Commands:
        1) git checkout master
        2) git merge whateverBranchName

       OR

   Discard work from branch and DON’T merge with the local master branch...
    Commands:
        1) git checkout master
        2) git branch -D whateverBranchName (deletes the branch and all the work you committed!)

   --> FOURTH STEP
    Push up changes from local master branch to remote repository (GitHub repo)...
    Command: git push origin master

To list all created branches...
Command: git branch


================================= GIT BRANCHING EXERCISE


Create a branch of your name:

    git checkout -b firstname-lastname


In this branch, use the following command to create a new file: 

    touch branch-test.txt


Add and commit the change:

    git add . (or git add branch-test.txt)

    git commit -m “Add branch-test.txt”


Check your list of branches:
    
    git branch


Checkout to master:

    git checkout master


Merge the changes from your branch

    git merge firstname-lastname
